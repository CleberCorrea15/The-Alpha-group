# Alpha Group Simulations

This directory contains Python scripts implementing simulations related to the Alpha Group framework, as described in the series of articles on the Alpha Group, including *The Alpha Group Dynamic Mapping*.

## Overview

The Alpha Group is a novel algebraic and topological framework proposed to describe the emergence of the \( S^4 \) topology and the coherent structure of space. The simulations here explore the dynamical behavior of matrices \( M(\theta) \) from the Alpha Group, analyzing how topological features emerge through iterative dynamics.

## Contents

- `Alpha_group_ODE_solution_0_radians.py`
- phase_lyapunov_solution_0_radians.py  
  Simulation script for the dynamic mapping of the Alpha Group matrix \( M(0 radians) \).

- `Alpha_group_ODE_solution_1.57_radians.py`
- phase_lyapunov_solution_1.57_radians.py
Simulation script for the dynamic mapping of the Alpha Group matrix \( M(1.57 radians) \).


## How to Run

1. Ensure you have the required Python packages installed:  
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib ripser persim scipy
   ```

2. Run the main simulation script:  
   ```bash
   python Alpha_group_ODE_solution_1.57_radians.py
   ```

3. Use the visualization and analysis scripts to explore the generated data.
